Loan Approval Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

The Loan Approval Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, education, loan amount, and employment status.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training

Model evaluation

Explainable AI (SHAP)

Optional dashboard integration (Power BI / Streamlit)

🎯 Objectives

Predict loan approval status accurately

Understand key factors influencing loan approval

Build an interpretable ML model

Create a real-world finance domain project

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Type: Supervised Classification

Target Variable: Loan_Status (Approved / Not Approved)

📊 Dataset Description
